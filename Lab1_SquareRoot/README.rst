Lab 1: Square Root
##################

Submit your solution for finding the square root of any number here. The
submission should be a set of instructions, created using a text editor, not a
word processor. Vim is fine, as is any other programmers editor you want to
use. Place the file inside this folder and do this:

..  code-block:: bash

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "some message"
    $ git push origin master

You repeat the above three commands each time you stop working on a project.
When the project is ready for grading, we will mark it using a "tag". We will
go over that in class.
